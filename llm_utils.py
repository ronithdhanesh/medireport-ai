    For each test:

        - Cross-check whether the value falls within or near the reference range.
        - If the value appears *significantly outside* the reference range (e.g. 2x higher or lower), assume it may be a possible OCR error.
        - In such cases, include a key called "Suspected OCR Error" with value true.
        - Optionally suggest a corrected value as "Estimated Value" if it can be reasonably inferred.

    Make sure every item contains a valid "Value".
